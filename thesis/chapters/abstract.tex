This thesis presents a novel approach to automated code refactoring localization using diffusion models combined with Large Language Models (LLMs). 

\textbf{Background:} Code refactoring is a crucial practice in software engineering that improves code quality and maintainability without changing its external behavior. However, identifying code segments that require refactoring remains a time-consuming and expertise-dependent task.

\textbf{Objectives:} This research aims to develop an automated system that leverages the generative capabilities of diffusion models and the semantic understanding of LLMs to accurately identify and localize code segments requiring refactoring.

\textbf{Methods:} [Describe your methodology - data collection, model architecture, training approach, evaluation metrics]

\textbf{Results:} [Summarize key findings - performance metrics, comparison with baselines, notable observations]

\textbf{Conclusions:} [State main conclusions and contributions]

\textbf{Keywords:} Code Refactoring, Diffusion Models, Large Language Models, Software Engineering, Machine Learning, Code Quality, Static Analysis
